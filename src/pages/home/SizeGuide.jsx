          <p>
            We live in a society where fast fashion is our primary source of
            clothing. Even though it can be an easy and accessible way to get
            something to wear, we at Kerber think this is completely
            unsustainable and something we actively want to change - That's why
            we provide one of the most important steps for a more sustainable
            and eco-friendly wardrobe. Learning the care of different garments
            will increase their longevity and the more knowledge you gain the
            easier it'll be to find your favourite material for future
            investments - that you'll wear and love for years and years!

          <p className="size">SILK</p>
          <p>
            Silk is a natural protein fibre composed of fibroin made by the silk
            worm cocoon. The fibers are super light but the strongest natural
            fibre available and has really good insulation properties (warm in
            winter/cool in summer) plus is hypoallergenic. Did you know that
            silk actually cleans itself - just in plain air? We recommend that
            you air your garments regularly instead of constantly washing - good
            for the item AND the environment! â™¥ The gorgeous shimmer is due to
            the prism-like structure of the fibre. Being a little strenuous to
            wash, when taking proper care of silk it is one of the best and most
            luxurious materials to ever wear.

          <p className="size">Wool</p>
          <p>
            The classic, timeless, natural fibre wool. Derived from sheep, the
            fibre is shaved off and then spun into threads. Wool is fire
            retardant and resistant to water, odour, and stains and has really
            good insulation properties (warm in winter/cool in summer). When you
            use a heavy knitted wool item the fibres might come loose and form
            little balls as a direct result of friction (which naturally occurs
            with movement), so use a wool brush/stone to remove them. As one of
            natures best materials we can't praise wool enough for its many
            benefits.

          <p className="size">VISCOSE</p>
          <p>
            Viscose is a regenerated natural fibre, like bamboo or eucalyptus,
            that is extracted chemically, which makes it an in-between of
            synthetic and natural. It is also called artificial silk for its
            similarities, softness and shine. It's breathable, drapes well,
            highly absorbent, strong and doesn't get static build-up.

          <p className="size">LINEN</p>
          <p>
            Linen is a natural fibre made from the cellulose that grows inside
            the stalks of the flax plant, one of the oldest cultivated plants in
            human history. It's very strong, absorbent and dries fast. Linen is
            an annual plant which makes it rare and more costly to produce and
            harvest, but also more luxurious than other fabrics.

          <p className="size">COTTON</p>

          <p>
            {" "}
            Cotton is a natural fiber that grows with the seeds of the cotton
            plant. It's comfortable to wear, absorbs moisture and breathes well.
            It withstands heat, detergents, bleach and resists static
            electricity - its lesser sides can be easy wrinkling and can be slow
            to dry.size
