// I configured  my react router. It navigates into the different routes as i expect it to. but, I see duplicate display in 4 of the route component. This duplication happens each time i import the Navarbar component in any of the router. but when i remove the imported Navbar, the duplication stops. I feel the problem is from the imported Navbar. The coe only works properly in Home and About page. Pleas HelpðŸ˜­.I will paste the navar code below, but  this the source code of the full project for better understanding of the problem:  https://chibuzor-coder.github.io/thia-e-comerce/
